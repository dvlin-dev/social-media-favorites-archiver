# Social Media Favorites Archiver

Use this workflow for backing up, migrating, or organizing a user's own personal favorites collections from Bilibili, Xiaohongshu/RedNote, or Douyin into a local Markdown/Obsidian vault.

Do not use it for a single video transcription, one-image OCR, ordinary summarization, public-account scraping, marketing copy, reposting, commenting, or other bookmark products.

## Safety boundary

- Work only with the user's authorized account and dedicated browser profile.
- Do not bypass platform access controls, QR checks, captchas, device confirmation, rate limits, or anti-bot controls.
- Do not print or persist Cookie values, authorization headers, signed media URLs, browser storage, private raw responses, or private content in logs and fixtures.
- Keep live databases, media, vaults, reports, and raw evidence outside the Skill directory and Git.
- Keep ASR, OCR, media processing, and Markdown generation local. Send only the documented text allowlist when the user explicitly enables optional enrichment.
- Preview cleanup first. Delete only item-owned cached media after every derivative and final-note verification succeeds.

## Install the CLI

If `smfa` is not already available, install the immutable public release:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/dvlin-dev/social-media-favorites-archiver.git@v1.0.0
```

Run `smfa --help` after installation. Do not replace the tag with a moving branch.

## Workflow

1. Read [configuration](references/configuration.md), choose user-owned vault/state/cache paths, and keep enrichment disabled unless requested.
2. Run `smfa doctor --config /absolute/path/to/config.yml`. Fix local prerequisites without displaying secrets.
3. Run `smfa login <platform> --config /absolute/path/to/config.yml` for each requested platform. Pause only when the platform asks the user to complete QR, captcha, login, account, or device confirmation; resume immediately afterward.
4. Run `smfa collections <platform> --config /absolute/path/to/config.yml` and let the user select collections when their intent is ambiguous.
5. Run `smfa sync <platform> --metadata-only --config /absolute/path/to/config.yml` first so skeleton notes become visible quickly. Report discovered/skeleton counts separately from heavy work.
6. Run `smfa sync <platform> --foreground --config /absolute/path/to/config.yml` to drain durable local ASR/OCR/fusion/render/verify/cleanup work. Use `--limit` only for representative validation because limited enumeration must not reconcile removals.
7. Run `smfa status --json` and `smfa report --json`; report aggregate outcomes and sanitized diagnostic codes only. Retry safe failures with `smfa retry failed`.
8. Repeat per platform, continuing past a platform-specific failure when the other authorized platforms can proceed safely.

After each platform, report metadata progress, heavy-stage progress, tests/checks, blockers requiring user action, and the next platform. Do not claim an unavailable content type passed without real evidence.

## Platform routing

- Read [Bilibili](references/platform-bilibili.md) for yt-dlp, native subtitle, ASR fallback, and multi-part behavior.
- Read [Xiaohongshu / RedNote](references/platform-xiaohongshu.md) for article, ordered gallery, video, OCR, and ephemeral media behavior.
- Read [Douyin](references/platform-douyin.md) for cursor pagination, video/gallery, burned captions, and ASR × OCR fusion.
- Read [troubleshooting and scheduling](references/troubleshooting.md) for exit codes, resumability, safe cleanup, login recovery, and optional timers.

The base archive never depends on cloud enrichment. Missing or failed optional enrichment must preserve the complete local archive.

The distributable Skill bundle is MIT-0; the Python application source remains MIT.
